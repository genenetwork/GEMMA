# INSTALL GEMMA: Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association

## Check version

Simply run gemma once installed

    gemma

and it should give you the version.

## GEMMA dependencies

GEMMA runs on Linux and MAC OSX and the runtime has the following
dependencies:

* C++ tool chain
* GNU Science library (GSL)
* blas
* [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/)
* zlib

## Install GEMMA

### Bioconda

(Note Bioconda install is a work in [progress](https://github.com/xiangzhou/GEMMA/issues/52)

Recent versions of GEMMA can be installed with
[BioConda](http://ddocent.com/bioconda/) without root permissions using the following
command

    conda install gemma

### GNU Guix

The GNU Guix package manager can install recent versions of [GEMMA](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/packages/g.html)
using the following command

    guix package -i gemma

### Install from source

Install listed dependencies and run

	make -j 4

(the -j switch builds on 4 cores).

if you get an Eigen error you may need to override the include
path. E.g. on GNU Guix with shared libs the following may work

    make EIGEN_INCLUDE_PATH=~/.guix-profile/include/eigen3 FORCE_DYNAMIC=1 WITH_OPENBLAS=1

to run GEMMA tests

    make check

Other options, such as compiling with warnings, are listed in the
Makefile
