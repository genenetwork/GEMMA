# GEMMA: Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association

GEMMA is a software toolkit for fast application of linear mixed
models (LMMs) and related models to genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) and other large-scale data sets.

Check out [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) to see what's new in each GEMMA release.

Please post comments, feature requests or suspected bugs to
[Github issues](https://github.com/xiangzhou/GEMMA/issues). We also
encourage contributions, for example, by forking the repository,
making your changes to the code, and issuing a pull request.

Currently, GEMMA is supported for 64-bit Mac OS X and Linux
platforms. *Windows is not currently supported.* If you are interested
in helping to make GEMMA available on Windows platforms (e.g., by
providing installation instructions for Windows, or by contributing
Windows binaries) please post a note in the
[Github issues](https://github.com/xiangzhou/GEMMA/issues).

## Key features

1. Fast assocation tests implemented using the univariate linear mixed
model (LMM). In GWAS, this can correct for population structure and
sample nonexchangeability. It also provides estimates of the
proportion of variance in phenotypes explained by available genotypes
(PVE), often called "chip heritability" or "SNP heritability".

2. Fast association tests for multiple phenotypes implemented using a
multivariate linear mixed model (mvLMM). In GWAS, this can correct for
populations tructure and sample nonexchangeability jointly in multiple
complex phenotypes.

3. Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM) for estimating PVE,
phenotype prediction, and multi-marker modeling in GWAS.

4. Estimation of variance components ("chip heritability") partitioned
by different SNP functional categories from raw (individual-level)
data or summary data. For raw data, HE regression or the REML AI
algorithm can be used to estimate variance components when
individual-level data are available. For summary data, GEMMA uses the
MQS algorithm to estimate variance components.

## Quick start

1. Download and install the software. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

2. Work through the demo. *Give more details here.*

3. Read the manual and run `gemma -h`. *Give more details here.*

## Setup

To install GEMMA you can

1. Download the precompiled binaries (64-bit Linux and Mac only).

2. Use existing package managers, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

3. Compile the GEMMA executable from source.

Compiling from source takes more work, but can boost performance of
the program, especially when using specialized C++ compilers and
numerical libraries.

Source code and [latest stable release][latest_release] are available
from the Github repository.

### Precompiled binaries

1. Go to the [latest stable release](latest_release) and download the
file appropriate for your platform: `gemma.linux.gz` for Linux, or
`gemma.macosx.gz` for Mac OS X.

2. Run `gunzip gemma.linux.gz` or `gunzip gemma.linux.gz` to
decompress the file.

3. For convenience, the binaries we provide are linked to static
versions of the GSL, LAPACK and BLAS libraries. So you do not need to
install these libraries.

4. Cince the program dynamically links to standard C++ and system
libraries, *you need to make sure that you have installed on your
system the same C++ compiler that was used to build the program.* For
example, `gemma.linux` was built using `gcc 4.8.5`, so you should have
`gcc 4.8.x`. If the libraries are installed somewhere non-standard,
you can tell where GEMMA can find the libraries by setting the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. If you have the wrong version
of the C++ compiler, or if the libraries are in a place where GEMMA
cannot find them, then the program will complain about dynamic linking
errors.

### Building from source

*We provide a simple Makefile which will need to be customized; please
see the comments at the top of the Makefile. Explain why we
automatically generate a Makefile using programs such as CMake or
Autotools.*

You will need a standard C/C++ compiler such as GNU gcc, as well as
[GSL](http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl) and
[LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack) libraries. You will need to
change the library paths in the Makefile accordingly.

*Revise this step:* You will need to download the
[Eigen C++ library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), and copy the `Eigen`
subdirectory into the `src` directory of the GEMMA repository. (It was
last tested using Eigen version 3.3.3.)

More information on source code, dependencies and installation can be
found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
